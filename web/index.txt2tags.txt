h1. Introduction

pyaosocket is a renamed and slightly updated version of aosocketnativenew, the [Python for S60 https://garage.maemo.org/projects/pys60] native extension that served as a basis for the aosocket library developed in the [PDIS http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/] project at [HIIT http://www.hiit.fi/].

We did not previously release the library separately, but it could be found as part of the full [PDIS releases http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/pdis/].

h1. Status

The library has been extensively tested as part of PDIS, but conceivably post-PDIS changes could have broken something.

h1. License

The code is still covered by the MIT license, as it was when initially released as part of PDIS. For the original PDIS license, look at the [PDIS Source Tree download page http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/pdis/].

h1. Download

A [collection of release builds download/] is available. The ``self`` variant is self-signed, with maximum self-signable capabilities. The ``dev`` variant is signable with Symbian's Open Signed Online or with a developer certificate, and has maximum capabilities allowed by Open Signed Online.

You may or may not find the [changelog https://github.com/contextlogger/pyaosocket/commits/master/] useful in trying to determine what has changed between releases.

A [Git http://git-scm.com/] repository of the source code (with change history) is also available, hosted on GitHub at http://github.com/contextlogger/pyaosocket.

h1. Dependencies

The software should run on S60 2nd and 3rd edition devices (and probably on newer platform versions as well), and it depends on the Python for S60 runtime. Does not depend on non-public APIs or anything exotic.

h1. Acknowledgements

The library was created in the [PDIS project http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/] at [HIIT http://www.hiit.fi/].
