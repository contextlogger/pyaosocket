h1. Introduction

pyaosocket is a renamed and slightly updated version of aosocketnativenew, the [Python for S60 http://www.forum.nokia.com/python] native extension that served as a basis for the aosocket library developed in the [PDIS http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/] project at [HIIT http://www.hiit.fi/].

We did not previously release the library separately, but it could be found as part of the full [PDIS releases http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/pdis/].

h1. Status

The library has been extensively tested as part of PDIS, but conceivably post-PDIS changes could have broken something.

h1. License

The code is still covered by the MIT license, as it was when initially released as part of PDIS. For the original PDIS license, look at the [PDIS Source Tree download page http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/pdis/].

h1. Download

A [collection of release builds ../download/] is available. The ``sisx`` file without a version number is the latest release. You may or may not find the [changelog.txt changelog.txt] file useful in trying to determine what has changed between releases.

A [darcs http://darcs.net/] repository of the [source code ..] (with change history) is also available, and can be retrieved with the ``get`` command of ``darcs``.

h1. Dependencies

The software should run on S60 2nd and 3rd edition devices, and it depends on the [Python for S60 http://www.forum.nokia.com/python/] runtime. Does not depend on non-public APIs or anything exotic.

h1. Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Send patches to the below email address. The ``send`` command of ``darcs`` may be used.

h1. Acknowledgements

The library was created in the [PDIS project http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/] at [HIIT http://www.hiit.fi/].
